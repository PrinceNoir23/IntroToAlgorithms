# 📘 Solutions to *Introduction to Algorithms* (Cormen)

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book **"Introduction to Algorithms"** by Thomas H. Cormen et al.  

The goal is to solve the problems using **Go** and **Rust**, with contributions from two authors: **Joel** and **Wilson**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The folder hierarchy is organized by **programming language → author → chapter**:


### 🗂 Folder naming
- `chXX/` → refers to **Chapter XX** from the book.  
- Inside each chapter, solutions are named according to the exercise number, for example:
  - `ex01.go` → Exercise 1 of the chapter, written in Go.  
  - `ex02.rs` → Exercise 2 of the chapter, written in Rust.  (maybe cargo new chXX --vcs=none [ I don't know if I could do this or the best way to organice the code  ] )

## 🔀 Branching Strategy

We use three main branches:

- `main` → Contains the general structure and documentation.  
- `joel` → Joel’s working branch for solutions.  
- `wilson` → Wilson’s working branch for solutions.  

Each contributor works on their own branch and can later open Pull Requests into `main`.

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

1. Create a new folder if the chapter does not exist yet.  
2. Place your solution inside the correct path:
   - **Language → Author → Chapter**  
3. Follow the file naming convention:  
   - `exNN.go` for Go solutions.  
   - `exNN.rs` for Rust solutions.  
4. Document non-trivial code with short comments.  
5. Commit with descriptive messages, e.g.:

## 📌 Notes
- This repository is intended for **study purposes only**.  
- Exercises are solved independently; solutions may vary between authors.  
- Comparing Go vs Rust implementations is encouraged.
